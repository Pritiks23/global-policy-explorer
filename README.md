#  Global Policy Explorer

A fully AI-native project that uses **Weaviate**, **GraphRAG**, and **NLWeb** to make global treaties and policy clauses searchable, comparable, and understandable. Powered by **Gemini API**, this tool transforms dense legal documents into actionable insights through semantic search, graph-based reasoning, and natural language interaction.

##  What Makes This Project Unique

This solution combines three powerful technologies:

- **Weaviate**: Indexes policy clauses with semantic embeddings for concept-based search.
- **GraphRAG**: Builds a dynamic knowledge graph connecting countries, treaties, clauses, and outcomes.
- **NLWeb**: Provides a natural language interface so users can ask complex questions and receive clear, comparative answers.

Unlike traditional legal databases, this project doesn‚Äôt just retrieve documents‚Äîit interprets them, connects them, and makes them actionable.

##  Core Features

-  **Semantic Search**: Find relevant clauses across treaties using concept-based queries.
-  **Clause-Level Indexing**: Each clause is stored with metadata (country, treaty, domain).
-  **Graph-Based Reasoning**: Explore relationships between countries, clauses, and outcomes.
-  **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions like ‚ÄúCompare climate commitments of G7 countries.‚Äù
-  **Comparative Analysis**: Automatically compare clauses across jurisdictions.
-  **Document Explorer**: Navigate full treaties with clause-level insights.
-  **Alerts & Updates**: Subscribe to topics and get notified when new treaties are signed.
-  **Multilingual Support**: Semantic search works across languages using multilingual embeddings.

##  Target Customers & Problem Solved

### Target Users:
- Policy analysts, journalists, diplomats, advocacy groups, academics, and students.

### Problem:
Global policy documents are fragmented, dense, and difficult to compare across countries and legal systems.

### Solution:
This project makes policy searchable, explainable, and comparable‚Äîturning static documents into dynamic intelligence.

**Tools!**
üåê GraphRAG: The Reasoning Engine
Role: GraphRAG builds and maintains a dynamic knowledge graph that connects entities and ideas.

What it does:

Links countries, treaties, clauses, and outcomes into a structured graph.

Supports graph-based reasoning, enabling users to explore relationships and dependencies.

Powers comparative analysis by identifying how different countries approach similar issues.

Why it matters: Policy isn‚Äôt just about isolated clauses‚Äîit‚Äôs about how they interrelate. GraphRAG transforms static text into actionable intelligence by showing connections and patterns.

NLWeb: The Conversational Interface
Role: NLWeb is the natural language front-end that makes the system intuitive and accessible.

What it does:

Lets users ask complex questions like ‚ÄúCompare climate commitments of G7 countries.‚Äù

Translates user queries into structured searches across Weaviate and GraphRAG.

Returns clear, comparative answers‚Äînot just documents.

Why it matters: Legal and policy research is often inaccessible. NLWeb democratizes it by allowing users to interact with the system in plain language, no technical expertise required.
What Makes This Project Unique
Clause-Level Intelligence: Most systems index whole documents; this one zooms in on the clause level.

Semantic + Graph Fusion: Combines deep semantic understanding with structured reasoning.

Actionable Insights: Goes beyond retrieval‚Äîusers get explanations, comparisons, and alerts.
