# 🌍 Global Policy Explorer

A fully AI-native project that uses **Weaviate**, **GraphRAG**, and **NLWeb** to make global treaties and policy clauses searchable, comparable, and understandable. Powered by **Gemini API**, this tool transforms dense legal documents into actionable insights through semantic search, graph-based reasoning, and natural language interaction.

## 🚀 What Makes This Project Unique

This solution combines three powerful technologies:

- **Weaviate**: Indexes policy clauses with semantic embeddings for concept-based search.
- **GraphRAG**: Builds a dynamic knowledge graph connecting countries, treaties, clauses, and outcomes.
- **NLWeb**: Provides a natural language interface so users can ask complex questions and receive clear, comparative answers.

Unlike traditional legal databases, this project doesn’t just retrieve documents—it interprets them, connects them, and makes them actionable.
