#  Global Policy Explorer

A fully AI-native project that uses **Weaviate**, **GraphRAG**, and **NLWeb** to make global treaties and policy clauses searchable, comparable, and understandable. Powered by **Gemini API**, this tool transforms dense legal documents into actionable insights through semantic search, graph-based reasoning, and natural language interaction.

##  What Makes This Project Unique

This solution combines three powerful technologies:

- **Weaviate**: Indexes policy clauses with semantic embeddings for concept-based search.
- **GraphRAG**: Builds a dynamic knowledge graph connecting countries, treaties, clauses, and outcomes.
- **NLWeb**: Provides a natural language interface so users can ask complex questions and receive clear, comparative answers.

Unlike traditional legal databases, this project doesn’t just retrieve documents—it interprets them, connects them, and makes them actionable.

##  Core Features

-  **Semantic Search**: Find relevant clauses across treaties using concept-based queries.
-  **Clause-Level Indexing**: Each clause is stored with metadata (country, treaty, domain).
-  **Graph-Based Reasoning**: Explore relationships between countries, clauses, and outcomes.
-  **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions like “Compare climate commitments of G7 countries.”
-  **Comparative Analysis**: Automatically compare clauses across jurisdictions.
-  **Document Explorer**: Navigate full treaties with clause-level insights.
-  **Alerts & Updates**: Subscribe to topics and get notified when new treaties are signed.
-  **Multilingual Support**: Semantic search works across languages using multilingual embeddings.
